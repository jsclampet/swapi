## Summary
This app allows users to navigate and through a searchable table of all StarWars characters.

My goal in creating this app was to get more experience with retreiving data from API's and displaying it to the front end.


I opted for making my API request in the async-await context.
<!-- I encounter 

use async/await syntax for a cleaner code structure.
Used Axios library for handling API requests, as it provided a simpler syntax for working with APIs.

 
Use the data retreived from the initial API request, which includes URL's, to make subsequent API requests. 

This is where the postman API tool shined. I was able to run multiple quick API call tests to see what object properties and were returned in the responses.  -->

<!-- Learned
- How useState is updated ... synchronous, but delayed/async behaviour
- Loading state , how/when to notify app loading status
- Promise.all 
- Making subsequent API calls based on primary API call
- Importance and ease of use/convenience of typing ( Character object, Array of type Character) -->
